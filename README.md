# Player Performance Prediction

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the performance of players based on their attributes. The prediction model is a pre-trained machine learning model (`Random Forest Regressor`) saved using `pickle`.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Enter player attributes via a web form.
- **Prediction**: Get a predicted performance score based on the input attributes.
- **Confidence Interval**: Receive a confidence interval for the prediction to understand the reliability of the model's output.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pickle
